## Syllabus

### Day 1

* Day 1 - 2023.03.29  15:00-19:00

* Introduction to the Open Source development process using GitHub (forking and pull-request).
* Continuous Integration (CI) to ensure different contributors don't interfere with each-other.

* Old way in open source:
    * start from the code you have (but it might have been already outdated)
    * change code
    * use `diff` to created  diff-file (also called a patch).
    * send the diff to developer of the project or to the mailing list of the project if it had one.
    * Use the `patch` command to integrated the changed to the most recent version of the source code.

* We discussed how GutHub with the idea of forking made this process much easier.

* We saw the fork, pull-request process in a drawing.

* We saw a few Pull-Request in the [Forem in GitHub](https://github.com/forem/) project (the platform on which [DEV.to](https://dev.to/) runs).

* We saw how to accept a Pull-Request in the [Kantoniko - Ladino dictionary](https://kantoniko.com/) project.

* We discussed the 3 ways to accept a pull-request.
    * Create a merge commit
    * Squash and merge
    * Rebase and merge

* We created a Pull-Request adding a JSON file to our website.

* We hadd issues enabling workflow and checked the [GitHub Status](https://www.githubstatus.com/) page. GitHub Actions was basically down.

* We discussed a few examples of [GitHub Actions](https://code-maven.com/github-actions) (Bash, Python, and Postgres)

* Git commit, push, staging
* What is a fork (historically, in GitHub it is friendly)
* What is a branch

### Day 3

* Day 3 - 2023.06.19  14:00-18:00

* The wealth of GitHub (Issues, diffs, blame, insights, watching, stars)
* Create Github pages - Creating a free website using Markdown and static site generators.

* Docker - containerization for easier on-boarding and to reduce the risk of executing unknown code on our system.

### Day 4

* Introduction to automated testing. A testing demo with a Python project.
* On request of the participants there can be demo for other programming languages as well.
* How open source projects ensure high quality. CI systems, test farms.


## Prerequisites

No programming background is required. People without programming background will have non-programming assignments.
